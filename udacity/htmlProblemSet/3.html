  <h1>Red Riding Hood</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Red Riding Hood. She loved wearing her bright red cape, so much so that everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood. One day, her mother asked her to take some food to her grandmother who lived in the forest. Little Red Riding Hood eagerly agreed and set off on her journey.</p>
    <p>As she was walking through the forest, she met a big, bad wolf who asked her where she was going. Little Red Riding Hood, being the innocent little girl she was, told the wolf where she was headed. The wolf, being sly and cunning, suggested that Little Red Riding Hood pick some flowers for her grandmother along the way. Little Red Riding Hood agreed and went off to pick some flowers. While she was picking flowers, the wolf went to her grandmother's house and gobbled her up! When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, the wolf pretended to be her grandmother and gobbled her up too.</p>
